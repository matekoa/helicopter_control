# Helicopter Control Lab - EEE3094S

## From the Lab:
Measured the response of a model of the *vertical motion* and *sinusoidal motion* dynamic of a helicopter and used this data to derive the linearized dynamic model of the helicopter. The system model is to be found using both step response and frequency response methods.
